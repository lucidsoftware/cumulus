  module Common
    # Public: Base class for AWS resource manager classes.
    #
    # Classes that extend this class should provide the following methods:
    #
    #   resource_name - return the resource name type (ie "Autoscaling Group", "Security Group", etc)
    #   local_resources - return a Hash of local resource name to local resource config object
    #   aws_resources - return a Hash of aws resource name to aws resource object
    #   diff_resource - a function that will produce an array of differences between the local resource
    #     passed in and the aws resource passed in
    #   unmanaged_diff - return the correct type of diff from an AWS resource
    #   added_diff - return the correct type of diff from a local configuration object
    #   create - given a local configuration, create the AWS resource
    #   update - given a local configuration and an array of diffs, update the AWS resource
    #
    # Additionally, the following instance variables can be set to change the behavior of the manager:
    #
    #   create_asset - if true, the asset will be created, if false, a warning will be printed about
    #     the asset not being created
